"""Run-config plumbing around the `[env]` block: narrowing the `env` field of every
config that owns one, and the retired keys such a config refuses.

A run composes the blocks it needs — `[env]` (what runs, `configs/env.py`),
`[serve]` (how it's hosted, `configs/serve.py`), `[legacy]` (the v0 bridge,
`configs/legacy.py`) — plus its own fields. Nothing here is a base class: the eval
CLI, GEPA, and a trainer each declare their blocks and call these.

Declare the env field as `SerializeAsAny[EnvConfig] = Field(default_factory=
single_agent_env_config)`. The `SerializeAsAny` is load-bearing: pydantic serializes
by declared type, so a plain `EnvConfig` silently drops a narrowed subclass's agents
and knobs from `model_dump()` — the env-server wire's payload."""
