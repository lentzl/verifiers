"""Prime Agent failures that must be loud.

Every bug this integration hit scored *wrongly* rather than erroring: a starved
follow-up, an ACP turn that reported a clean `end_turn` after failing, an agent
inheriting the runner's uv interpreter. Each looked like a weak model instead of
broken infrastructure.

So these guards convert "the evidence is missing" into an exception. A fixture
that silently returns 0.0 when metadata is absent is indistinguishable from a
fixture whose agent genuinely failed, and that ambiguity is what hides bugs.
