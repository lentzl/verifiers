# Agent

An `Agent` is a configured `harness` with a model running in a `Runtime`. It can be configured with an `AgentConfig`. An agent is given a `Task` and produces a `Trace`.

```python
async with vf.make_agent(vf.AgentConfig(model="z-ai/glm-5.2")) as solver:
    trace = await solver.run(vf.Task(vf.TaskData(prompt="What is 2+2?")))
```

`agent.interaction(task)` holds a rollout open turn by turn. The caller acts as the
user, and each `turn()` runs one harness segment (i.e., a message, tool call, tool result etc.). A `Segment` therefore contains messages, tool calls etc.

```python
async with agent.interaction(task) as interaction:
    segment = await interaction.turn("hello")
    if not segment.terminated:
        segment = await interaction.turn(f"you said: {segment.last_reply}")

trace = interaction.trace
```
