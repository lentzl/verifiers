# Evaluation

To evaluate any taskset, use the `eval` entrypoint:

```bash
uv run eval primeintellect/terminal-bench-2
```

You can also use `.toml` files for configuration:

```toml
model = "nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Ultra-550B-A55B"

[sampling]
temperature = 1.0

[env.taskset]
id = "primeintellect/terminal-bench-2"

[env.agent.harness]
id = "codex"
version = "0.116.0"

[env.agent.runtime]
type = "docker"
```

Validate the config by using `uv run eval @ config.toml --dry-run`. To run the evaluation, use `uv run eval @ config.toml`.

Use dotted arguments to set values using the CLI, e.g. `--sampling.temperature 0.5`. CLI arguments overwrite toml arguments when both are present.

The output from evaluations are written into `outputs/<env>--<model>--<harness>/<uuid>/` by default, where `<env>` is the taskset, prefixed by the paired env id when `--env.id` sets one (use `output_dir` to overwrite the folder). The folder contains the used `config.toml`, all the episodes in `traces.jsonl`, as well as logs of the run and workers in `eval.log`.

## Common config values

- `model` — the model id to evaluate, e.g. `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Ultra-550B-A55B`
- `sampling` — generation params passed to the model, e.g. `sampling.temperature`
- `env.taskset.id` — pick the taskset (or the positional `eval <taskset-id>`)
- `env.agent.harness.id` — pick the agent's harness (`[env.agent.harness]` in TOML)
- `num_tasks` — how many tasks to evaluate. Not setting a value means all tasks; an
  infinite taskset (a procedural generator, e.g. `wordle-v1`) requires it
- `num_rollouts` — rollouts per task
- `verbose` — log at debug instead of info
- `shuffle` — samples the task order (fixed seed); an error on an infinite taskset

## Resuming evaluations

`--resume <output-dir>` re-runs only the rollouts a previous run left missing or errored, appending to that run's own `traces.jsonl`. It reloads the run's saved `config.toml` verbatim, so it takes no other arguments. Good rollouts are kept, while errored ones are dropped and redone.

## Disabling tools

Almost every harness comes with a `disabled_tools` list, which can be used to disable one or multiple tools:

```toml
[env.agent.harness]
disabled_tools = ["shell_tool"]
```

The names of these tools are set by the respective harness. Consult the relevant documentation for the given harness for the relevant name(s). Some harnesses do not offer support to disable tools.

## Skills

Harnesses whose program supports SKILL.md skills natively (e.g. Claude Code, Codex) take a `skills` list of local skill folders, each uploaded into the program's skill discovery directory in the agent's runtime as `<skills dir>/<folder name>`:

```toml
[env.agent.harness]
skills = ["path/to/my-skill"]
```

Setting `skills` on a harness without native skill support fails up front.
